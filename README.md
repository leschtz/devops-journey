# DevOps Journey

This repository serves as documentation for my journey getting a DevOps Engineer.

Previously I worked in the semiconductor Industry, where I realised, the administration, maintaining services and pipelines, defining processes, is something I enjoy and am passionate about. I love the little challenges, an environment, a cloud service, a setup may introduce. It fulfills me to solve these. Therefor I want to transition from the Software Developer role into the DevOps role. 

I wish myself all the best.
