# DevOps Journey

This repository serves as documentation for my journey getting a DevOps Engineer.

Previously I worked in the semiconductor Industry, where I realised, the administration, maintaining services and pipelines, defining processes, is something I enjoy and am passionate about. I love the little challenges, an environment, a cloud service, a setup may introduce. It fulfills me to solve these. Therefor I want to transition from the Software Developer role into the DevOps role. 

I wish myself all the best.

## Programming Languages

I will mostly use `python3` and `bash`. I am very comfortable using these languages and have previous professional experience with them. My goal is to get comfortable with the technologies and concepts behind DevOps, which is a big task already.

## Choosen Tech Stack

- [ ] AWS
- [ ] Terraform
- [ ] Ansible
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] Github Actions

### Cloud Providers
With the job postings I have been looking at, the following Stack is the most important one. What my own research has shown, is that most Cloud Providers, as AWS is, share similar interfaces and general concepts. With a tool like Terraform, this should be abstracted away in any case. 

Something I have not yet decided, is what services I am going to learn. Important to me is, that I don't have to pay money, therefor my learning experience is limited by AWS Free Tier. However, with EC2 Instances, Databases and Lambda services, many things are provided to learn.

### CI/CD
For pipelines, I have read about Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Jenkins (which I am familiar with already), Azure DevOps, Argus CI, Keptn and more. Here I will focus on Github Actions, as it integrates well with the repository and it enables me to deploy my own runners. 

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a tool I do not fully understand yet. What I have grasped so far is, that there is `k8s`, which seems to be standard and a fully-fledged solution. `Helm` is a tool to control and manage Kubernetes Clusters. For learning purpose, I will try to setup a cluster with `k3s`, which is a Kubernetes distribution, suited for a lower footprint. 

### Infrastructure and Configuration as Code
`Terraform` and `Ansible` are the selected tools here. While there are different tools available, those two are most mentioned with job ads. 

### Containerization/Virtualization

Virtualization and Containers are not my main focus, however those are essential tools, as they provide me with environments I will work in. As a result, this topic will be covered __on the go__.

#### Conclusion

While many different tools exist, I try to focus on these, I have read the most about those.
